## About the Club 🚀
The Competitive Programmers and Mentorship Club
(C.P.M.C.) is a project started by D.Y.P.C.O.E. students.
This club aims to strengthen students' problem-solving skills
through competitive programming, form a mentor-mentee
relationship between juniors and seniors, increase student
confidence, and much more.

<br>
Here's why CP & CPMC:

*  With competitive programming, you continuously train yourself with algorithmic problems that test the better out of your current logic skills. By practicing more and more you get better and this improves your programming logic.
* Thinking about a problem and finding its solution makes you more focused.
* Make you a desirable candidate for major companies
* Our campus has a variety of clubs, including some wellknown ones such as GDSC and TEDx, but none of them
focus on competitive programming or mentorship activities. As a result, our group fills a need and provides us with the ideal opportunity to assist kids in an
uncharted territory.
